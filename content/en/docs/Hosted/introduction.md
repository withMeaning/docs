Our goal for with Meaning is to build the most universal and personal recommender out there. Both for universality, which requires many integrations with the rest of the internet, as well as for the privacy that self-hosting can offer, we decided to open source all of our back-end code.

But we also want to offer a convenient and easy to use platform for everyone, as well as build a sustainable business. We therefore provide a hosted service, against a monthly subscription.

For this we are currently building a web app, and a mobile companion. If you want to contribute and are a React / Flutter developer, reach out! Come back to sign up to our waitlist, or message the developers.
