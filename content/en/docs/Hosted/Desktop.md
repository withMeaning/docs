## How to manage your attention

Currently in the works.

Note: You can still use the progressive web app at [reader.withmeaning.io](https://reader.withmeaning.io), but it's currently touch and not mouse optimized. Tipp: use the [TabFloater](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabfloater-picture-in-pic/iojgbjjdoanmhcmmihbapiejfbbadhjd) extension and this [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script `^SPACE::  Winset, Alwaysontop, , A` (instead of the TabFloater companion) to always know what you are doing!
