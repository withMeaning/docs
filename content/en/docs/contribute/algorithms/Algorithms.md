## or how to write your own algorithm

Spiles are the core of withmeaning. They have the huge task of selecting a very, very small number of things from the near infinite things that are possible.

Spiles take three inputs, Lakes, Stream Files and Feedback, in order to output the Stream.

### Lakes

### Stream Files
A Stream File is a document that describes what you want in life, and how your ideal day would look like. They are like config files for your algorithm, containing simple statements like "show me no more than 3 cat videos a day". Here is an [example](https://www.remnote.com/a/Stream-File/64a439b24b02c7b8b4150719).
like a config file for your algorithm, in the simplest case it's just a note in which you describe
### Metadata
In order to 
This is usually just a simple databank that's related to the lake, with metadata like whether or not a task is already done,


## Stream Sentries

For now, the best algorithm is to work with another person. If you have an assistant, withmeaning is an excellent way of coordinating your day and filtering your information services. Just instruct them to write
